# Grade: 7.3 


## Version Control: Excellent,10 
All code is under version control and for each feature and each algorithm there is at least a separate commit. Final findings can be easily reproduced running an Jupyter electronic notebook. Important intermediate data is available and can be used to verify later processing steps.

## Python Code: Good, 8
Code works as intended and intentions are indicated in code comments. Each Python module or script contains a header explaining it purpose, these headers make use of lightweight markup were necessary.

## Documentation: Good, 8
Sufficient documentation is available to allow for reproduction of the results. Documentation facilitates use and maintenance of code in future projects.

## Machine Learning: 7
Partly correct application of machine learning methods for cluster analysis and classification. Parameters of the machine learning methods are varied and data is correctly split in training, validation and test data. Note: split is not correct for the cluster algorithm, with in all likelihood overfitting for the situation with the maximum number of clusters.

## Comparison of Algorithms and Features:  Fair, 5.5
No ROC or Coverage plot used for comparing classifiers and features or they are used incorrectly. Confusion matrices are used and extensive reporting of accuracies over parameter ranges.

## Feature Construction: 7.5
Multiple feature sets are used with motivation. Temporal alignment is applied correctly. Note: the language used reflects confusion about the nature of the representations used.
